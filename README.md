# Sorting-visualizer-python

Project Overview
This Sorting Visualizer is a Python project built using the Tkinter library, aimed at visualizing common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, and others. It provides an intuitive and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) to help users understand how these algorithms work by observing the sorting process in real-time.

Features
Visualization: Watch sorting algorithms in action as they dynamically rearrange bars representing array elements.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Random Data Generation: Generate random data for sorting.
Customizable Speed: Adjust the speed of the sorting visualization.
GUI Controls:
Start sorting
Choose sorting algorithm
Reset or re-generate random data
Technology Stack
Language: Python
GUI Library: Tkinter (built-in Python library)
Other Modules: Random (for generating random data), Time (for controlling the speed of visualization)
Screenshots
(Include one or two screenshots showing the interface and the sorting in action.)

Prerequisites
Python 3.x must be installed on your system.

To verify if Python is installed, run:

bash
Copy code
python --version
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer-tkinter.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd sorting-visualizer-tkinter
Install required dependencies (Tkinter comes with Python, but in case you donâ€™t have it installed):

On Linux or MacOS, Tkinter can be installed using:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
On Windows, Tkinter should be included with your Python installation by default.
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python sorting_visualizer.py
Usage
Start the Application: Once you run the program, a window will open with a canvas displaying bars representing an unsorted array.

Select Sorting Algorithm: Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.

Generate Data: Click the "Generate Data" button to generate a new random array.

Adjust Speed: Use the slider to adjust the speed of the sorting process.

Start Sorting: Press the "Start" button to begin the sorting visualization.

Reset: Click "Generate Data" again to reset and generate a new unsorted array.

Sorting Algorithms Implemented
Bubble Sort: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Repeats until the list is sorted.
Selection Sort: Repeatedly selects the smallest element and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing and inserting elements in their correct position.
Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, sorts them, and then merges them.
Quick Sort: Uses a pivot to partition the list into smaller and larger elements, then recursively sorts the partitions.
How the Visualizer Works
The array to be sorted is displayed as a series of vertical bars where the height of each bar represents the value of an element. As the sorting algorithm progresses, the bars are rearranged in real-time, showing the step-by-step sorting process.

The Tkinter Canvas widget is used to draw the bars, and the after() method is employed to introduce a delay in the sorting algorithms for visualization purposes.

Future Improvements
Add more sorting algorithms like Heap Sort or Radix Sort.
Improve the UI/UX with better control buttons and themes.
Allow users to input custom data.
Add explanations for each algorithm.
